# bitesized-workshop-materials
 This repository contains the materials used in various bite-sized workshop that I conducted during my stint in SMU Libraries. Bite-sized workshops are short 90-minutes workshop intended to introduce beginners to various concepts in a more "digestible" size. The primary aim is to equip the participants with enough basics so that they can continue the learning on their own. 
 
 Some workshops may be recorded. The recordings are available here in SMU's mediacast (only accessible to current SMU staff/students)
